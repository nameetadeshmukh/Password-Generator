# Password-Generator
1. Define Requirements
Length of the Password: Typically between 12-16 characters.
Character Set: Include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and special characters.
Complexity: Ensure passwords are random and avoid predictable patterns.
2. Set Up Your Java Project
Create a new Java project using your preferred IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse) or a simple text editor. Make sure you have JDK installed.
3. Key Considerations
SecureRandom: Use SecureRandom to generate cryptographically strong random numbers, ensuring your passwords are less predictable.
Character Set: Include a broad range of characters to increase entropy and make the passwords harder to guess.
Shuffling: Shuffle the characters to avoid predictable patterns in the generated passwords.
4. Advanced Features
User Customization: Allow users to specify password length and character sets.
Strength Validation: Integrate a mechanism to assess the strength of generated passwords based on criteria such as entropy and complexity.
5. Testing
Edge Cases: Test with different lengths and ensure that generated passwords meet your requirements.
Security Review: Review the code to ensure it adheres to secure coding practices and best practices.
6. Security Best Practices
Regular Updates: Keep your code and dependencies up to date to mitigate vulnerabilities.
Secure Storage: If passwords are stored, use secure hashing algorithms and avoid storing plaintext passwords.
